This app borrows from the these livelabs workshops as far as concepts but uses different tables, open source libraries, etc. as well....
Graph Studio: Find Circular Payment Chains with Graph Queries in Autonomous Database
Explore Operational Property Graphs in 23ai

These are two tables used in workshop...

CREATE TABLE "HOL23AI"."BANK_ACCOUNTS" (
"ID" NUMBER,
"NAME" VARCHAR2(400) ,
"BALANCE" NUMBER(20,2),
PRIMARY KEY ("ID")
)

CREATE TABLE "HOL23AI"."BANK_TRANSFERS" (
"TXN_ID" NUMBER,
"SRC_ACCT_ID" NUMBER,
"DST_ACCT_ID" NUMBER,
"DESCRIPTION" VARCHAR2(400),
"AMOUNT" NUMBER,
PRIMARY KEY ("TXN_ID"),
FOREIGN KEY ("SRC_ACCT_ID") REFERENCES "HOL23AI"."BANK_ACCOUNTS" ("ID"),
FOREIGN KEY ("DST_ACCT_ID") REFERENCES "HOL23AI"."BANK_ACCOUNTS" ("ID")
);


In this dev workshops, we reuse the accounts table...

CREATE TABLE "FINANCIAL"."ACCOUNTS"
(
"ACCOUNT_ID" NUMBER(19,0) NOT NULL ENABLE,
"ACCOUNT_BALANCE" NUMBER(19,0) reservable,
"CUSTOMER_ID" VARCHAR2(255 CHAR),
"ACCOUNT_NAME" VARCHAR2(255 CHAR),
"ACCOUNT_OPENED_DATE" TIMESTAMP (6),
"ACCOUNT_OTHER_DETAILS" VARCHAR2(255 CHAR),
"ACCOUNT_TYPE" VARCHAR2(255 CHAR)
);

and so create the transfers table as this (basically just changing "BANK_ACCOUNTS" ("ID") to "ACCOUNTS" ("ACCOUNT_ID")...

CREATE TABLE TRANSFERS (
"TXN_ID" NUMBER,
"SRC_ACCT_ID" NUMBER,
"DST_ACCT_ID" NUMBER,
"DESCRIPTION" VARCHAR2(400),
"AMOUNT" NUMBER,
PRIMARY KEY ("TXN_ID"),
FOREIGN KEY ("SRC_ACCT_ID") REFERENCES "ACCOUNTS" ("ACCOUNT_ID"),
FOREIGN KEY ("DST_ACCT_ID") REFERENCES "ACCOUNTS" ("ACCOUNT_ID")
);
